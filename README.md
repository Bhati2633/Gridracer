# 🚀 GridRacer: Visualizing Dijkstra’s Algorithm

**Created by:** Bhavya   
**Tech Stack:** React • JavaScript • HTML/CSS

---

## 🔍 Overview

**GridRacer** is an interactive web-based tool designed to help users understand how **Dijkstra’s Algorithm** works in a fun, visual, and engaging way. Built with React, the tool combines game-like interaction with algorithm visualization to bridge the gap between theory and intuition.

## 📌 Problem

Navigating delivery routes in urban areas is complex due to buildings, traffic, and varying path weights.  
While Dijkstra’s algorithm is a powerful solution for finding the shortest path, it’s often difficult to understand **how** it works step-by-step — especially for beginners.

---

## 🧩 Our Solution

With **GridRacer**, users can:
- 🖱️ **Draw custom paths** by right-clicking and dragging across the grid.
- 🎞️ **Visualize Dijkstra’s algorithm** step-by-step or through autoplay.
- 🔍 **Compare** their own path with the optimal path generated by the algorithm.

This hands-on approach helps users **see where their logic differs**, and learn how the algorithm makes decisions.

## 🎨 Visual Cues

Each cell on the grid represents part of the map:
- 🔵 **Start node**  
- 🔴 **Destination node**  
- 🟠 **Current node being evaluated**  
- 🟢 **Visited nodes**  
- 🟡 **Neighbors being considered**  
- 🟣 **Final shortest path**

Some cells are **buildings** (impassable), and others have **weighted costs** that influence pathfinding.

---

## ⚙️ Technical Highlights

- Built using **React** with `useState` for dynamic updates and `useEffect` for animation control.
- The grid, weights, and visited state are managed via **2D arrays**.
- **Dijkstra’s algorithm implemented from scratch** — no third-party libraries.
- A basic **priority queue** simulation using nested loops.

## 🔧 Key Features

- 🎮 **Interactive gameplay** with path-drawing and live feedback
- ⏱️ **Speed controls** for visualization playback
- 🧠 **Score system** based on total path weight
- 📈 **Level progression** with increasing complexity
- 🏆 **Local high score tracking** for replayability
